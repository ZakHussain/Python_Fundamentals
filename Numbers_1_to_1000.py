#Use the for loop and don't use array to do this excercise

#how to make a for loop: for <counter> in <sequence or range> 

for count in range (1,1001):
 print count



#Part II
#Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.
for count in range(5, 1000000):
	if count % 5 = 0:
	 print(count)
